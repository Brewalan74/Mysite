            <p class="para">For 3 years, I worked as a travel advisor for a Travel Agency from my home (teleworking). I must say, I am a lot more efficient when I work from home than when I work in a office with chatty colleagues... Asian Roads is the main company name which brings together many small agencies spread all over Asia. I worked for China Roads which is specializes in travel to China. The boss of China Roads is also the boss of Asian Roads. My main work was to contact customers, to plan tours and builds up itinaries according to the customer's request, to quotes and provide pricing, invoicing, reply customer's emails, make reservation... During the low season, my work was to create new tours and showcase them on the China Roads Website, to produce some content for the same website... The last year (2020), due to the pandemic, I have mainly worked on 3 websites of the company by using WordPress. My work was to create new pages, format these new pages, create new contents, upload these new contents...</p>

            <p class="para">At the end of my Professional Bachelor Degree, I had to do an internship, I choose to do it in Thailand in a receptive travel agency. From my experince as a trainee, I had the opportunity to plan some tours and builds up itineraries due to request, booking, providing quotes and pricing for tours, invoicing, reply customer's emails, request contract rate hotel, make reservation for customers... but also to do different administrative works... My choice to do my internship there was because I like to work abroad and its always a good opportunity to work in a different work environment I think... but its not for the beaches or the sun! I worked there 6 days a week from 9am to 6pm with one hour break for lunch. So I didnt really have time to visit Phuket and thats why before to go back to France, I spent 15 days at Bangkok to visit the city and some other cities around. </p>
